# Blackboard-Project
The code I wrote for the self-rotating blackboard project. The blackboard can rotate itself when glare is detected on the blackboard.
This is the Arduino code that controls the motor which rotates the blackboard. There's a data filter function in the document which you may find useful. 
The other light detecting module's code is based on a OPENMV camera which is not posted here.
